## How It Works

### Document Processing
1. User uploads a PDF document
2. Document is stored in AWS S3
3. PDF is processed using LangChain's PDFLoader
4. Document is split into smaller chunks for better context management
5. Each chunk is converted to embeddings using OpenAI
6. Embeddings are stored in Pinecone vector database with metadata

### Chat Interface
1. User asks a question about the document
2. Question is converted to embeddings
3. Similar chunks are retrieved from Pinecone using semantic search
4. Retrieved chunks are used as context for the AI
5. OpenAI generates a response based on the context
6. Response is displayed to the user
7. Chat history is stored in PostgreSQL database
